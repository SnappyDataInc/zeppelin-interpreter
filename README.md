# Snappydata Interpreter for Apache Zeppelin

## Overview
[SnappyData](http://snappydatainc.github.io/snappydata/) is a distributed in-memory data store for real-time operational analytics, delivering stream analytics, OLTP (online transaction processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing) in a single integrated cluster. We realize this platform through a seamless integration of Apache Spark (as a big data computational engine) with GemFire XD (as an in-memory transactional store with scale-out SQL semantics).
